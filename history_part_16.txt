The Muslim League
Initially floated in Dhaka in
1906, the Muslim League
was quickly taken over by
the U.P.-based Muslim elite.
The party began to make
demands for autonomy for
the Muslim-majority areas of
the subcontinent and/or
Pakistan in the 1940s.

Hindu Mahasabha
Founded in 1915, the Hindu
Mahasabha was a Hindu party
that remained confined to North
India. It aimed to unite Hindu
society by encouraging the
Hindus to transcend the divisions
of caste and sect. It sought
to define Hindu identity in
opposition to Muslim identity.

Confederation  in modern
political language it refers to a
union of fairly autonomous and
sovereign states with a central
government with delimited
powers

The name Pakistan
The name Pakistan or Pak-stan
(from Punjab, Afghan, Kashmir,
Sind and Baluchistan) was
coined by a Punjabi Muslim
student at Cambridge, Choudhry
Rehmat Ali, who, in pamphlets
written in 1933 and 1935,
desired a separate national
status for this new entity. No one
took Rehmat Ali seriously in
the 1930s, least of all the League
and other Muslim leaders who
dismissed his idea merely as a
students dream.

THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  PART III
Moreover, while the leading Congress leaders in the
late 1930s insisted more than ever before on the
need for secularism, these ideas were by no means
universally shared lower down in the party
hierarchy, or even by all Congress ministers.
Maulana Azad, an important Congress leader,
pointed out in 1937 that members of the Congress
were not allowed to join the League, yet
Congressmen were active in the Hindu Mahasabha
at least in the Central Provinces (present-day
Madhya Pradesh). Only in December 1938 did the
Congress Working Committee declare that Congress
members could not be members of the Mahasabha.
Incidentally, this was also the period when the
Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak
Sangh (RSS) were gaining strength. The latter
spread from its Nagpur base to the United Provinces,
the Punjab, and other parts of the country in the
1930s. By 1940, the RSS had over 100,000 trained
and highly disciplined cadres pledged to an ideology
of Hindu nationalism, convinced that India was a
land of the Hindus.
3.3 The Pakistan Resolution
The Pakistan demand was formalised gradually.
On 23 March 1940, the League moved a resolution
demanding a measure of autonomy for the Muslimmajority areas of the subcontinent. This ambiguous
resolution never mentioned partition or Pakistan.
In fact Sikandar Hayat Khan, Punjab Premier and
leader of the Unionist Party, who had drafted the
resolution, declared in a Punjab assembly speech
on 1 March 1941 that he was opposed to a Pakistan
that would mean Muslim Raj here and Hindu Raj
elsewhere ... If Pakistan means unalloyed Muslim
Raj in the Punjab then I will have nothing to do with
it. He reiterated his plea for a loose (united),
confederation with considerable autonomy for the
confederating units.
The origins of the Pakistan demand have also
been traced back to the Urdu poet Mohammad Iqbal,
the writer of Sare Jahan Se Achha Hindustan
Hamara. In his presidential address to the Muslim
League in 1930, the poet spoke of a need for a NorthWest Indian Muslim state. Iqbal, however, was not
visualising the emergence of a new country in that
speech but a reorganisation of Muslim-majority

areas in north-western India into an autonomous
unit within a single, loosely structured Indian
federation.
3.4 The suddenness of Partition
We have seen that the League itself was vague
about its demand in 1940. There was a very short
time  just seven years  between the first formal
articulation of the demand for a measure of autonomy
for the Muslim-majority areas of the subcontinent
and Partition. No one knew what the creation of
Pakistan meant, and how it might shape peoples
lives in the future. Many who migrated from their
homelands in 1947 thought they would return as
soon as peace prevailed again.
Initially even Muslim leaders did not seriously
raise the demand for Pakistan as a sovereign state.
In the beginning Jinnah himself may have seen
the Pakistan idea as a bargaining counter, useful
for blocking possible British concessions to the
Congress and gaining additional favours for the
Muslims. The pressure of the Second World War on
the British delayed negotiations for independence
for some time. Nonetheless, it was the massive Quit
India Movement which started in 1942, and persisted
despite intense repression, that brought the British
Raj to its knees and compelled its officials to open a
dialogue with Indian parties regarding a possible
transfer of power.
3.5 Post-War developments
When negotiations were begun again in l945, the
British agreed to create an entirely Indian central
Executive Council, except for the Viceroy and the
Commander -in-Chief of the armed forces, as a
preliminary step towards full independence.
Discussions about the transfer of power broke down
due to Jinnahs unrelenting demand that the League
had an absolute right to choose all the Muslim
members of the Executive Council and that there
should be a kind of communal veto in the Council,
with decisions opposed by Muslims needing a twothirds majority. Given the existing political situation,
the Leagues first demand was quite extraordinary,
for a large section of the nationalist Muslims
supported the Congress (its delegation for these
discussions was headed by Maulana Azad), and in
West Punjab members of the Unionist Party were

The Muslim League
resolution of 1940
The Leagues resolution of
1940 demanded:
that geographically contiguous
units are demarcated into
regions, which should be
so constituted, with such
territorial readjustments as
may be necessary, that the
areas in which the Muslims are
numerically in a majority as
in the north-western and
eastern zones of India should
be grouped to constitute
Independent States, in which
the constituent units shall
be autonomous and sovereign.

 What was the League
demanding? Was it
demanding Pakistan as
we know it today?

largely Muslims. The British had no intention of
annoying the Unionists who still controlled the
Punjab government and had been consistently loyal
to the British.
Provincial elections were again held in 1946. The
Congress swept the general constituencies, capturing
91.3 per cent of the non-Muslim vote. The Leagues
success in the seats reserved for Muslims was equally
spectacular: it won all 30 reserved constituencies in
the Centre with 86.6 per cent of the Muslim vote and
442 out of 509 seats in the provinces. Only as late as
1946, therefore, did the League establish itself as the
dominant party among Muslim voters, seeking to
vindicate its claim to be the sole spokesman of
Indias Muslims. You will, however, recall that the
franchise was extremely limited. About 10 to 12 per
cent of the population enjoyed the right to vote in the
provincial elections and a mere one per cent in the
elections for the Central Assembly.

3.6 A possible alternative to Partition
In March 1946 the British Cabinet sent a threemember mission to Delhi to examine the Leagues
demand and to suggest a suitable political framework
for a free India. The Cabinet Mission toured the
country for three months and recommended a loose
three-tier confederation. India was to remain united.
It was to have a weak central government controlling
only foreign affairs, defence and communications
with the existing provincial assemblies being
grouped into three sections while electing the
constituent assembly: Section A for the Hindumajority provinces, and Sections B and C for the
Muslim-majority provinces of the north-west and the
north-east (including Assam) respectively. The
sections or groups of provinces would comprise
various regional units. They would have the
power to set up intermediate-level executives and
legislatures of their own.
Initially all the major parties accepted this plan.
But the agreement was short-lived because it was
based on mutually opposed interpretations of the
plan. The League wanted the grouping to be
compulsory, with Sections B and C developing into
strong entities with the right to secede from the
Union in the future. The Congress wanted that
provinces be given the right to join a group. It was
not satisfied with the Missions clarification that
grouping would be compulsory at first, but provinces
would have the right to opt
out after the constitution had
been finalised and new
elections held in accordance
with it. Ultimately, therefore,
neither the League nor the
Congress agreed to the Cabinet
Missions proposal. This was
a most crucial juncture,
because after this partition
became more or less inevitable,
with most of the Congress
leaders agreeing to it, seeing
it as tragic but unavoidable.
Only Mahatma Gandhi and
Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of
the NWFP continued to firmly
oppose the idea of partition.

A voice in the wilderness
Mahatma Gandhi knew that his was a voice in the
wilderness but he nevertheless continued to oppose the
idea of Partition:
But what a tragic change we see today. I wish the day
may come again when Hindus and Muslims will do
nothing without mutual consultation. I am day and night
tormented by the question what I can do to hasten the
coming of that day. I appeal to the League not to regard
any Indian as its enemy  Hindus and Muslims are born
of the same soil. They have the same blood, eat the same
food, drink the same water and speak the same language.

 What are the arguments
that Mahatma Gandhi offers in
opposing the idea of Pakistan?

But I am firmly convinced that the Pakistan demand as
put forward by the Muslim League is un-Islamic and I
have not hesitated to call it sinful. Islam stands for the
unity and brotherhood of mankind, not for disrupting
the oneness of the human family. Therefore, those who
want to divide India into possible warring groups are
enemies alike of Islam and India. They may cut me to
pieces but they cannot make me subscribe to something
which I consider to be wrong.

3.7 Towards Partition
After withdrawing its support to the Cabinet Mission
plan, the Muslim League decided on Direct Action
for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced
16 August 1946 as Direct Action Day. On this day,
riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and
leaving several thousand people dead. By March 1947
violence spread to many parts of northern India.
It was in March 1947 that the Congress high
command voted for dividing the Punjab into two
halves, one with Muslim majority and the other
with Hindu/Sikh majority; and it asked for the
application of a similar principle to Bengal. By this
time, given the numbers game, many Sikh leaders
and Congressmen in the Punjab were convinced that
Partition was a necessary evil, otherwise they would
be swamped by Muslim majorities and Muslim
leaders would dictate terms. In Bengal too a section
of bhadralok Bengali Hindus, who wanted political
power to remain with them, began to fear the
permanent tutelage of Muslims (as one of their
leaders put it). Since they were in a numerical
minority, they felt that only a division of the
province could ensure their political dominance.

Without a shot
being fired
This is what Moon wrote:
For over twenty-four
hours riotous mobs were
allowed to rage through
this great commercial
city unchallenged and
unchecked. The finest
bazaars were burnt to the
ground without a shot
being fired to disperse
the incendiaries (i.e. those
who stirred up conflict). The
 District Magistrate
marched his (large police)
force into the city and
marched it out again
without
making
any
effective use of it at all 

The bloodbath continued for about a year from
March 1947 onwards. One main reason for this
was the collapse of the institutions of governance.
Penderel Moon, an administrator serving in
Bahawalpur (in present-day Pakistan) at the time,
noted how the police failed to fire even a single
shot when arson and killings were taking place in
Amritsar in March 1947.
Amritsar district became the scene of bloodshed
later in the year when there was a complete
breakdown of authority in the city. British officials
did not know how to handle the situation: they were
unwilling to take decisions, and hesitant to
intervene. When panic-stricken people appealed for
help, British officials asked them to contact
Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabh Bhai
Patel or M.A. Jinnah. Nobody knew who could
exercise authority and power. The top leadership of
the Indian parties, barring Mahatma Gandhi, were
involved in negotiations regarding independence
while many Indian civil servants in the affected
provinces feared for their own lives and property.
The British were busy preparing to quit India.
Problems were compounded because Indian
soldiers and policemen came to act as Hindus,
Muslims or Sikhs. As communal tension mounted,

UNDERSTANDING PARTITION
the professional commitment of those in uniform
could not be relied upon. In many places not only
did policemen help their co-religionists but they also
attacked members of other communities.
4.1 The one-man army
Amidst all this turmoil, one mans valiant efforts
at restoring communal harmony bore fruit. The
77-year -old Gandhiji decided to stake his all in a
bid to vindicate his lifelong principle of non-violence,
and his conviction that peoples hearts could be
changed. He moved from the villages of Noakhali in
East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) to the villages
of Bihar and then to the riot-torn slums of Calcutta
and Delhi, in a heroic effort to stop Hindus and
Muslims kill each other, careful everywhere to
reassure the minority community. In October 1946,
Muslims in East Bengal targeted Hindus. Gandhiji
visited the area, toured the villages on foot, and
persuaded the local Muslims to guarantee the safety
of Hindus. Similarly, in other places such as Delhi
he tried to build a spirit of mutual trust and

confidence between the two
communities. A Delhi Muslim,
Shahid Ahmad Dehlavi, compelled
to flee to a dirty, overcrowded
camp in Purana Qila, likened
Gandhijis arrival in Delhi on
9 September 1947 to the arrival
of the rains after a particularly
long and harsh summer. Dehlavi
recalled in his memoir how
Muslims said to one another:
Delhi will now be saved.
On 28 November 1947, on
the occasion of Guru Nanaks
birthday, when Gandhiji went to
address a meeting of Sikhs at
Gurdwara Sisganj, he noticed that there was no
Muslim on the Chandni Chowk road, the heart of
old Delhi. What could be more shameful for us,
he asked during a speech that evening, than the
fact that not a single Muslim could be found in
Chandni Chowk? Gandhiji continued to be in Delhi,
fighting the mentality of those who wished to drive
out every Muslim from the city, seeing them as
Pakistani. When he began a fast to bring about a
change of heart, amazingly, many Hindu and Sikh
migrants fasted with him.
The effect of the fast was electric, wrote Maulana
Azad. People began realising the folly of the violence
they had unleashed on the citys Muslims but it was
only Gandhijis martyrdom that finally ended this
macabre drama of violence. The world veritably
changed, many Delhi Muslims of the time recalled later.

5. Gendering Partition
5.1 Recovering women
In the last decade and a half, historians have been
examining the experiences of ordinary people during
the Partition. Scholars have written about the
harrowing experiences of women in those violent
times. Women were raped, abducted, sold, often many
times over, forced to settle down to a new life
with strangers in unknown circumstances. Deeply
traumatised by all that they had undergone, some
began to develop new family bonds in their changed

circumstances. But the Indian and Pakistani
governments were insensitive to the complexities of
human relationships. Believing the women to be on
the wrong side of the border, they now tore them
away from their new relatives, and sent them back
to their earlier families or locations. They did not
consult the concerned women, undermining their
right to take decisions regarding their own lives.
According to one estimate, 30,000 women were
recovered overall, 22,000 Muslim women in India
